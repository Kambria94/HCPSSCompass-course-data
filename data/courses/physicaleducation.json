      "description": "This course is designed to help students develop physical literacy through the application of health and skill-related concepts of fitness while engaging in lifelong physical activities. Students will explore physical literacy concepts through the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. Students set short- and long-term fitness goals based on physiological assessments. Students will use movement concepts and principles (e.g., force, motion, rotation) to analyze and improve performance of self and/or others in a variety of selected activities. This course should be taken sequentially with Health Education in Grade 9."
